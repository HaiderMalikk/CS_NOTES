My CS notes. Include Topics Like Data structures, Algorithms, OOP concepts

DATA STRUCTURES:
- Linked List (Building LinkedList (nodes and LinkedList), Iterating Through List, Adding Node to Start, Adding Node to End, Adding a Node After a Given Node, Adding Before a Given Node, Adding To Empty LL, Deleting First Node, Deleting Last Node, Deleting Node By Value)

Algorithms:
- Quick Sort 

OOP:
- Inheritance
