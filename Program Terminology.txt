* Stack vs Heap
The stack and the heap are two key memory areas used by programs to store data during execution
- Definition:
Stack: Used for statically allocated memory (e.g., local variables).
Heap: Used for dynamically allocated memory (e.g., objects).
- Management:
Stack: Managed automatically with LIFO order.
Heap: Managed manually or via garbage collection.
- Speed:
Stack: Faster due to simple allocation/deallocation.
Heap: Slower due to complex allocation and fragmentation.
- Memory Size:
Stack: Smaller, limited by OS (few MBs).
Heap: Larger, limited by available RAM.
- Scope and Lifetime:
Stack: Local scope; lifetime ends when function returns.
Heap: Global scope; lifetime persists until explicitly freed.
- Use Cases:
Stack: Function-local variables, parameters, and call info.
Heap: Dynamic data structures like trees, graphs, or large arrays.
- Common Errors:
Stack: Stack overflow from deep recursion or large variables.
Heap: Memory leaks and dangling pointers from poor memory management.
- Example:
Stack: int a = 10; (deallocated automatically).
Heap: int *b = malloc(sizeof(int)); (must be explicitly freed)

* Garbage Collection
Garbage collection (GC) is a process by which a programming language's runtime environment 
automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused memory, preventing memory leaks, 
and freeing the developer from manually managing memory allocation and deallocation.

* Pointers
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. 
Pointers are fundamental in languages like C, C++, and others that give you direct access to memory
EX:
int *ptr;  // Declares a pointer to an integer in C
int x = 10;
int *ptr = &x;  // ptr now holds the address of x
EX: pointers allow to allocate and free memory at runtime
int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));  // Allocates memory
*ptr = 42;
free(ptr);  // Frees the allocated memory

* compile time vs runtime
=============================================
### Overview
In programming, there are two main times when code is executed: compile time and runtime.
### Compile Time
Compile time is the time when the code is compiled into machine code.
This is the time when the code is checked for errors and warnings related to syntax and type mismatch
EX's
System.out.println("Hello, World!) # this will give a compile time error because of the missing ;
int x = 10;  // Value of x is known at compile-time and the type is also known at compile time so this dose not give any error.
### Runtime
Runtime is the time when the code is executed by the computer.
This is the time when the code is checked for errors and warnings related to logic ot data like: invalid user input or unavailable resources.
EX:
int arr = {1,2,3}; int x = arr[5]; // this will give a runtime error because the array index is out of bounds.
int y = (int) (Math.random() * 100);  // Random value generated at runtime
- SUMMARY: the compiler converts the array to machine code and gives x the value of index at 5 is there is no syntax or type error in the code
           the ex runs at compile time not knowing that at arr[5] there is nothing at runtime the value is determined for x where are[5] DNE and error is thown at runtime.

* Strongly Typed vs Weakly Typed Languages or Static vs Dynamic Typing
=============================================
### Overview
In programming, languages can be classified into two main categories: strongly typed and weakly typed. The
difference between these two lies in how the language handles data types.
### Strongly Typed Languages
In strongly typed languages, the data type of a variable is known at compile time. 
This means that we must declare the data type of a variable before using it. If we try to assign a value of the wrong type to a variable, the compiler will throw an error. 
EX: in java we say int x = 5; here x is of type int and we can't asign a string to x. here x is a static type it cant be changed at runtime.
### Weakly Typed Language
In weakly typed languages, the data type of a variable is determined at runtime.
This means that we do not need to declare the data type of a variable before using it and its type will automaticly be determined when we assign a value to it.
# EX: in python we say x = 5; here x is of type int but we can also say x = "hello, here x is a Dynamic type it can be changed at runtime.

* Compiled vs Interpreted Languages
=============================================
### Overview
In programming, languages can be classified into two main categories: compiled and interpreted. The
difference between these two lies in how the code is executed.
### Compiled Languages
In compiled languages, the code is first compiled into machine code before it is executed.
This means that the code is converted into a format that the computer's processor can understand.
EX: java, c, c++
### Interpreted Languages
In interpreted languages, the code is not compiled into machine code before it is executed.
Instead, the code is interpreted line by line by an interpreter then this interpreter will convert the code into machine code.
EX: python, ruby, javascript

*  High -Level vs Low-Level Languages
=============================================
### Overview
In programming, languages can be classified into two main categories: high-level and low-level. The
difference between these two lies in how close the language is to the computer's hardware.
### High-Level Languages
In high-level languages, the language is far away from the computer's hardware.
This means that the language is designed to be easy to use and understand, but it may not be
as efficient as low-level languages.
EX: python, java, c#
### Low-Level Languages
In low-level languages, the language is close to the computer's hardware.
This means that the language is designed to be efficient and fast, but it may be difficult to use
and understand.
EX: assembly, c, c++
