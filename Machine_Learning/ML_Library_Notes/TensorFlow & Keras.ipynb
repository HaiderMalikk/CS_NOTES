    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intuitive debugging - You can use print statements, breakpoints, and inspect values directly\n",
    "- Works with Python control flow - Standard if/else, loops work naturally\n",
    "- Easy .numpy() calls - Can convert tensors to NumPy arrays anytime\n",
    "- Great for prototyping - Fast iteration and development\n",
