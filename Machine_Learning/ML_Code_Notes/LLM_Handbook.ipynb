The vocabulary is built during training or loaded from a pre-trained model, with special tokens (PAD, UNK, BOS, EOS) typically assigned fixed IDs at the beginning.\n"

    "**OUTPUT:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello worldGoodbye\n",
    "worldGoodbye moon\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXPLANATION:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset variable is a `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline that transforms raw text into training-ready (input, target) pairs. It's a lazy iterator (doesn't process until called).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline steps:**\n",
    "1. **from_tensor_slices**: Creates dataset from list of strings\n",
    "2. **map(tokenizer)**: Converts each text → token IDs (e.g., \"Hello\" → [15496, 995])\n",
    "3. **unbatch()**: Flattens all sequences into one continuous token stream (sequence packing)\n",
    "4. **batch(8)**: Groups tokens into chunks of 8 (creates fixed-length sequences)\n",
    "5. **map(lambda)**: Splits each chunk into (input, target) where target = input shifted left\n",
    "6. **padded_batch(2)**: Groups 2 sequences into a batch, pads shorter ones to match length\n",
    "\n",
    "**How next-token prediction works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model predicts the NEXT token at EACH position, not just the last one:\n",
    "- Position 0: Given \"Hello\" → predict \"world\"\n",
    "- Position 1: Given \"Hello world\" → predict \"Goodbye\"  \n",
    "- Position 2: Given \"Hello worldGoodbye\" → predict \"moon\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So the target sequence shows what should be predicted at each step. The entire target = input shifted left by 1 token (each target is the next token).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunking Strategy Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Token stream: `[A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed batch** (current): `.batch(4)`\n",
    "- Chunk 1: `[A, B, C, D]` (tokens 0-3)\n",
    "- Chunk 2: `[E, F, G, H]` (tokens 4-7)\n",
    "- Chunk 3: `[I, J]` (tokens 8-9)\n",
    "- → No overlap, each token appears once\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sliding window**: `.window(size=4, shift=2, drop_remainder=True)`\n",
    "- Chunk 1: `[A, B, C, D]` (tokens 0-3)\n",
    "- Chunk 2: `[C, D, E, F]` (tokens 2-5, overlaps last 2 from chunk 1)\n",
    "- Chunk 3: `[E, F, G, H]` (tokens 4-7, overlaps last 2 from chunk 2)\n",
    "- → Overlap preserves context across chunks, useful for long documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT: Both strategies train on next-token prediction at EVERY position!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed batch:**\n",
    "- Chunk 1: `[A,B,C,D]` → trains: (A→B), (A,B→C), (A,B,C→D)\n",
    "- Chunk 2: `[E,F,G,H]` → trains: (E→F), (E,F→G), (E,F,G→H)\n",
    "- Each token appears ONCE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sliding window:**\n",
    "- Chunk 1: `[A,B,C,D]` → trains: (A→B), (A,B→C), (A,B,C→D)\n",
    "- Chunk 2: `[C,D,E,F]` → trains: (C→D), (C,D→E), (C,D,E→F)\n",
    "- Tokens C and D appear TWICE (extra training for better context)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** The chunking method only affects which tokens are grouped together, not how training works. Sliding window gives overlapping tokens extra exposure for better long-range dependencies."
