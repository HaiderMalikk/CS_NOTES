The vocabulary is built during training or loaded from a pre-trained model, with special tokens (PAD, UNK, BOS, EOS) typically assigned fixed IDs at the beginning.\n"

    "3. **unbatch()**: Flattens all sequences into one continuous token stream (sequence packing)\n",
    "4. **batch(8)**: Groups tokens into chunks of 8 (creates fixed-length sequences)\n",
    "5. **map(lambda)**: Splits each chunk into (input, target) where target = input shifted left\n",
    "6. **padded_batch(2)**: Groups 2 sequences into a batch, pads shorter ones to match length\n",

    "- Position 2: Given \"Hello worldGoodbye\" → predict \"moon\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Process**: How Unembedding Weights Are Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Initialization**: Unembedding matrix starts with random values (shape: `d_model × vocab_size`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forward Pass**:\n",
    "    - Transformer outputs → (batch, seq_len, d_model)\n",
    "    - Matrix multiply with unembedding weights → (batch, seq_len, vocab_size)\n",
    "    - Apply softmax → probability distribution over vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loss Calculation**:\n",
    "    - Compare predicted probabilities to actual next token (one-hot encoded)\n",
    "    - Compute cross-entropy loss: `loss = -log(P(correct_token))`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Backpropagation**:\n",
    "    - Gradients flow back from loss through softmax and unembedding layer\n",
    "    - Each row of the unembedding matrix (corresponding to one output dimension) gets updated based on prediction errors\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update Rule** (simplified):\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    unembedding_weights -= learning_rate × gradient\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: The unembedding layer learns which transformer output patterns correspond to which tokens. If the model frequently outputs vectors in a certain direction when \"cat\" should be next, those weights get strengthened to produce higher logits for \"cat\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "``` text\n",
    "d_model = 512\n",
    "vocab_size = 50000\n",
    "unembedding_matrix = tf.Variable(shape=(512, 50000))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Transformer output: (batch=1, seq_len=1, d_model=512)\n",
    "# After matmul: (batch=1, seq_len=1, vocab_size=50000)\n",
    "# Each position gets 50000 scores (one per possible next token)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mathamatically\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hidden vector h ∈ R^d_model # from tansfromer \n",
    "# Unembedding matrix W ∈ R^(d_model × vocab_size) # learned matrix\n",
    "# Logits l = h · W   → l ∈ R^vocab_size # 50000 logits as a result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The flow so far is as follows**: Token ID → Embedding → Transformer → Hidden Vector → Unembedding → Logits → Token ID → Word (where we pick the highest logit as next word)\n",
