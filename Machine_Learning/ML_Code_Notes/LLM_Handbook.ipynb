When you call `tokenizer.tokenize(text)`, it returns tokens as strings; `tokenizer(text)` returns token IDs; and `tokenizer.detokenize(ids)` converts IDs back to text. The vocabulary is built during training or loaded from a pre-trained model, with special tokens (PAD, UNK, BOS, EOS) typically assigned fixed IDs at the beginning.\n"

    "1. **from_tensor_slices**: Creates dataset from list of strings\n",
    "2. **map(tokenizer)**: Converts each text → token IDs (e.g., \"Hello\" → [15496, 995])\n",
    "3. **unbatch()**: Flattens all sequences into one continuous token stream (sequence packing)\n",
    "4. **batch(8)**: Groups tokens into chunks of 8 (creates fixed-length sequences)\n",
    "5. **map(lambda)**: Splits each chunk into (input, target) where target = input shifted left\n",
    "6. **padded_batch(2)**: Groups 2 sequences into a batch, pads shorter ones to match length\n",
    "\n",
    "**How next-token prediction works:**\n",

    "- Position 1: Given \"Hello world\" → predict \"Goodbye\"  \n",
    "- Position 2: Given \"Hello worldGoodbye\" → predict \"moon\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So the target sequence shows what should be predicted at each step. The entire target = input shifted left by 1 token (each target is the next token).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunking Strategy Comparison:**\n",
    "\n",

    "**Sliding window**: `.window(size=4, shift=2, drop_remainder=True)`\n",

    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT: Both strategies train on next-token prediction at EVERY position!**\n",

    "**Fixed batch:**\n",
    "- Chunk 1: `[A,B,C,D]` → trains: (A→B), (A,B→C), (A,B,C→D)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Process**: How Unembedding Weights Are Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Initialization**: Unembedding matrix starts with random values (shape: `d_model × vocab_size`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forward Pass**:\n",
    "    - Transformer outputs → (batch, seq_len, d_model)\n",
    "    - Matrix multiply with unembedding weights → (batch, seq_len, vocab_size)\n",
    "    - Apply softmax → probability distribution over vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loss Calculation**:\n",
    "    - Compare predicted probabilities to actual next token (one-hot encoded)\n",
    "    - Compute cross-entropy loss: `loss = -log(P(correct_token))`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Backpropagation**:\n",
    "    - Gradients flow back from loss through softmax and unembedding layer\n",
    "    - Each row of the unembedding matrix (corresponding to one output dimension) gets updated based on prediction errors\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update Rule** (simplified):\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    unembedding_weights -= learning_rate × gradient\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight**: The unembedding layer learns which transformer output patterns correspond to which tokens. If the model frequently outputs vectors in a certain direction when \"cat\" should be next, those weights get strengthened to produce higher logits for \"cat\".\n",

    "# After matmul: (batch=1, seq_len=1, vocab_size=50000)\n",

    "# Mathamatically\n",

    "# Hidden vector h ∈ R^d_model # from tansfromer \n",
    "# Unembedding matrix W ∈ R^(d_model × vocab_size) # learned matrix\n",
