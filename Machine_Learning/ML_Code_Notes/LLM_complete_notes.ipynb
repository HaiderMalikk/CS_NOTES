    "- After Tokenization, each token is mapped to a integer ID using a vocabulary\n",
    "- Vocabulary size (V) is very important\n",
    "  - Larger V -> model must have a bigger embedding matrix (page 50 in written notes) -> more parameters (hence a larger model)\n",

When you call `tokenizer.tokenize(text)`, it returns tokens as strings; `tokenizer(text)` returns token IDs; and `tokenizer.detokenize(ids)` converts IDs back to text. The vocabulary is built during training or loaded from a pre-trained model, with special tokens (PAD, UNK, BOS, EOS) typically assigned fixed IDs at the beginning.\n"
