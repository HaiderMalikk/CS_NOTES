    "    ### Detailed Explanation for Each Neuron:\n",
    "    For each neuron, the process is as follows:\n",
    "    - **Input**: The neuron receives the inputs from the previous layer (or directly from the image for the first layer).\n",
    "    - **Weights**: Each input is multiplied by a corresponding weight.\n",
    "    - **Weighted Sum**: The weighted sum of inputs is calculated.\n",
    "    - **Bias**: A bias is added to the weighted sum.\n",
    "    - **Activation**: The weighted sum (plus bias) is passed through an activation function (like ReLU) to get the output of the neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This process is repeated for every neuron in the network. For example, in the first hidden layer, there are 128 neurons, each performing the same steps with its own weights and bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Example for Neural Network (with 3 neurons and 4 inputs):\n",
    "    Consider a simplified network with 3 neurons and 4 inputs. Let's assume the input to the layer is a vector of size 4:\n",
    "    we want to go from 4 inputs to 3 outputs where each input and output is a neuron so we go from 4 neurons to 3 neurons.\n",
    "    then the weight matrix for the first layer would be of size 4x3 (4 inputs and 3 neurons) and the bias vector would be of size 3 (1 bias for each neuron).\n",
    "    these diementions are chosen so each neuron has its own weights and bias to learn from the inputs.        \n",
    "\n",
    "        X = [x1, x2, x3, x4]  # Input vector (4 features)\n",

    "            \n",
    "    - What dose all this mean:\n",
    "    In a neual network if we want to pick up for ex edges we will assume that some neuron lights up (activates) when it sees a pixel associated with an edge.\n",
    "    to do this we assign a weight between nuerons in 2 layers (the input and the output) and a bias to the neuron. the weight is a number that tells us how much the input influences the output layer for 2 layers\n",
    "    for ex if pixel 144 is fully lit in the input layer some nuron in the next layer will be activated (the weight will be positive) and if pixel 144 is not lit some nuron in the next layer will not be activated (the weight will be negative).\n",
    "    But ofcourse we will have more than one neuron for this edge, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    lets say there are 10 weights and 10 nurons coming from the input layer to this 1 output neuron in the next layer that determines some edge.\n",
    "    to see if that neruon is activated we will take the weighted sum of all the inputs. if its positive the nuron will be activated and if its negative the nuron will not be activated.\n",
    "    but what if we want the nuron to be activated when, lets say the weighted sum is more than 10?, then we add a bias to the weighted sum after we add a bias to the weighted sum the output will be positive if the weighted sum is more than 10, we can see how adding bias's can give favor to some inputs over others that the model think are more important.\n",
    "    After this step we plug the sum into a activation function (like ReLU or sigmoid) to get the final output of the neuron, which will be betwen 0 and 1 repersenting the probability.\n",
    "    this one nuron that tells us about the probability of just one small edge being there in our image. this is repeated for all the other neurons in the layer which all connect with other nurons in the next layer.\n",
    "    some activations from one layer bring about other activations in the next layer the goal is that in the last layer after calculating the activations for all the outputs there will be one neuron that will be activated for the digit in the image.\n",
    "    this will be the brightest nuron, the one with the highest activation. ofcourse any nuron can be 0-1 so to see the outputs as a probability distribution we apply softmax to the outputs of the last layer. the softmax will convert the outputs to a probability distribution between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    all the neurons's activations (0-1) will add up to 1 after the softmax. Then we take the neuron with the highest activation as the predicted digit. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The goal of having layers is that the first layer can pick up on some patterns like edges and the next layer can pick up on more complex patterns like corners and the last layer can pick up on the final digit. this is how we build a neural network with multiple layers.\n",
    "    Ofcourse this would be a example of a perfectly trained nural network. in reality we would start will all the connections but the layers would not be able to pick up any patterns, they dont know what a 9 looks like.\n",
    "    In reality we would start with random weights and biases and then train the model to learn the patterns in the data. this is done by using a loss function and an optimizer. the loss function will tell us how far off the predictions are from the actual labels and the optimizer will update the weights and biases to minimize this loss.\n",
    "    Slowly the model would fix its mistakes and update the weights to learn the patterns in the data then when presenting with 784 nurons the next layer will be able to pick up edges and patterns that make up that images number and so on in the next layers until the final layer will have learned which activation in the previous layers corresponds to which digit. \n",
